  ### Impact
  All versions of Pterodactyl Wings preior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to `1.4.4`.

  ### Workarounds
  There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.
