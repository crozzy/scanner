description: The Elastic APM agent for Go versions before 1.11.0 can leak sensitive
  HTTP header information when logging the details during an application panic. Normally,
  the APM agent will sanitize sensitive HTTP header details before sending the information
  to the APM server. During an application panic it is possible the headers will not
  be sanitized before being sent.
