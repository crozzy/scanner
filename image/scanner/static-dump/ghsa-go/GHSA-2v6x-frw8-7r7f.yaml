description: A security issue was discovered in kube-state-metrics 1.7.x before 1.7.2.
  An experimental feature was added to v1.7.0 and v1.7.1 that enabled annotations
  to be exposed as metrics. By default, kube-state-metrics metrics only expose metadata
  about Secrets. However, a combination of the default kubectl behavior and this new
  feature can cause the entire secret content to end up in metric labels, thus inadvertently
  exposing the secret content in metrics.
