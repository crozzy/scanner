description: An issue was discovered in Rancher 2 through 2.1.5. Any project member
  with access to the default namespace can mount the netes-default service account
  in a pod, and then use that pod to execute administrative privileged commands against
  the k8s cluster. This could be mitigated by isolating the default namespace in a
  separate project, where only cluster admins can be given permissions to access.
  As of 2018-12-20, this bug affected ALL clusters created or imported by Rancher.
