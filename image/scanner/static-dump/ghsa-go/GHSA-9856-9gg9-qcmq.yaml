description: "### Impact\n\nA vulnerability in the Geth EVM could cause a node to
  reject the canonical chain. \n\n### Description \n\nA memory-corruption bug within
  the EVM can cause a consensus error, where vulnerable nodes obtain a different `stateRoot`
  when processing a maliciously crafted transaction. This, in turn, would lead to
  the chain being split in two forks.\n\nAll Geth versions supporting the London hard
  fork are vulnerable (which predates London), so all users should update.\n\nThis
  bug was exploited on Mainnet at block 13107518, leading to a minority chain split.
  \n\n### Patches\n\nA patch is included in the `v1.10.8` release.\nThe exact patch
  to fix the issue is contained within this [commit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23381/commits/4d4879cafd1b3c906fc184a8c4a357137465128f)\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds exist, save to update and/or apply the patch commit.

  Credits\n\nThe bug was found by @guidovranken (working for [Sentnl](https://sentnl.io/)
  during an audit of the [Telos EVM](https://www.telos.net/evm)) and reported via
