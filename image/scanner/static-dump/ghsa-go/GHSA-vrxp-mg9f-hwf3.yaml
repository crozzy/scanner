  ### Impact
  Authenticated attackers posing as functionaries (i.e., within a trusted set of users for a layout) are able to create attestations that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker with access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains a disallowed artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo vs dir/../foo).

  ### Patches
  The problem has been fixed in version 0.3.0.

  ### Workarounds
  Exploiting this vulnerability is dependent on the specific policy applied.
