description: "### Impact\nAn ethash mining DAG generation flaw in Geth could cause
  miners to erroneously calculate PoW in an upcoming epoch (estimated early January,
  2021). This happened on the ETC chain on 2020-11-06. This issue is relevant only
  for miners, non-mining nodes are unaffected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is also
  fixed as of 1.9.24. Thanks to @slavikus for bringing the issue to our attention
  and writing the fix. \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or
