description: go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES
  algorithm. When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose
  neglected to check that the received public key on a message is on the same curve
  as the static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an invalid
  curve attack.
