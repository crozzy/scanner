description: "### Impact\nData channel communication was incorrectly allowed with
  users who have failed DTLS certificate verification.\n\nThis attack requires \n*
  Attacker knows the ICE password. \n* Only take place during PeerConnection handshake.\n\nThis
  attack can be detected by monitoring `PeerConnectionState` in all versions of Pion
  WebRTC.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v3.0.15. \n\nThe exact patch is
  https://github.com/pion/webrtc/commit/545613dcdeb5dedb01cce94175f40bcbe045df2e\n\n###
  Workarounds\nUsers should listen for when `PeerConnectionState` changes to `PeerConnectionStateFailed`.
  When it enters this state users should not continue using the PeerConnection.\n\n###
