description: All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack
  via the "unarchive" functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive,
  that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive
  is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path
  ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with
  a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable
  or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the
  problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.
