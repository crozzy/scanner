  ### Impact

  Insecure permissions on temporary directories used in explicit and implicit container build operations.

  When a Singularity command that results in a container build operation is executed, it is possible for a user with access to the system to read the contents of the image during the build. Additionally, if the image contains a world-writable file or directory, it is possible for a user to inject arbitrary content into the running build, which in certain circumstances may enable arbitrary code execution during the build and/or when the built container is run.

  ### Patches

  This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.3.

  All users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.3.

  ### Workarounds

  The issue is mitigated if `TMPDIR` is set to a location that is only accessible to the user, as any subdirectories directly under `TMPDIR` cannot then be accessed by others. However, this is difficult to enforce so it is not recommended to rely on this as a mitigation.
