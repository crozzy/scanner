description: "### Impact\nThis is a Consensus vulnerability, which can be used to
  cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. \n\nGethâ€™s
  pre-compiled `dataCopy` (at `0x00...04`) contract did a shallow copy on invocation.
  An attacker could deploy a contract that \n\n- writes `X` to an EVM memory region
  `R`,\n- calls `0x00..04` with `R` as an argument,\n- overwrites `R` to `Y`,\n- and
  finally invokes the `RETURNDATACOPY` opcode.\n\nWhen this contract is invoked, a
  consensus-compliant node would push `X` on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push
  `Y`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this
