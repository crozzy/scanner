description: "There's an security issue in prosody-filer versions **< 1.0.1** which
  leads to unwanted directory listings of download directories. \n\nAn attacker is
  able to list previous uploads of a certain user by shortening the URL and accessing
  a URL subdirectors other than `/upload/` (or the corresponding user defined root
  dir)\n\nVersion 1.0.1 and later fix this problem and allow only direct file access
  if the full path is known. Directory listings are blocked entirely."
