  ## Impact

  Hugo depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. However, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.

  Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected.

  ## Patches
  Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1.
