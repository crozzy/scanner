  ### Impact
  Using a carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, a user with `UserWrite` permissions could create another user with higher privileges than their own due to insufficient checks on the allowed set of permissions. The event would be captured in the Event Log.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been fixed in 0.24.0 and 0.23.1.

  ### Workarounds
  For users who are unable to upgrade, we recommend auditing users who have `UserWrite` permissions and regularly reviewing the Event Log for malicious activity.

  ### Kudos
  Thank you to Michael Mazzolini (Ethical Hacker at WHO) for finding and disclosing this vulnerability.
