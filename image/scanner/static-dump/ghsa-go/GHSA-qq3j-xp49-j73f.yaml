description: "The Helm core maintainers have identified an information disclosure\nvulnerability
  in Helm 3.0.0-3.2.3. \n\n### Impact\n\nA traversal attack is possible when installing
  Helm plugins from a tar\narchive over HTTP.  It is possible for a malicious plugin
  author to inject a relative\npath into a plugin archive, and copy a file outside
  of the intended directory.\n\nTraversal Attacks are a form of a Directory Traversal
  that can be exploited by\nextracting files from an archive. The premise of the Directory
  Traversal\nvulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file
  system\noutside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can\nthen
  overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for\nthe system
  or user to call them, thus achieving Remote Command Execution on\nthe victim's machine.
  The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting\nconfiguration files or other
  sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both\nclient (user) machines and servers.\n\nhttps://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability\n\n###
  Patches\n\nThis issue has been fixed in Helm 3.2.4 \n\n### For more information\nIf
