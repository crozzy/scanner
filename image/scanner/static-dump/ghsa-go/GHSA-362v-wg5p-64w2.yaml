description: HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.8.x through 1.8.4 may have an
  unexpected interaction between glob-related policies and the Google Cloud secrets
  engine. Users may, in some situations, have more privileges than intended, e.g.,
  a user with read permission for the /gcp/roleset/* path may be able to issue Google
  Cloud service account credentials.
