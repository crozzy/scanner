  The Helm core maintainers have identified a high severity security vulnerability in Go's `crypto` package affecting all versions prior to Helm 2.16.8 and Helm 3.1.0.

  Thanks to @ravin9249 for identifying the vulnerability.

  ### Impact

  Go before 1.12.16 and 1.13.x before 1.13.7 (and the `crypto/cryptobyte` package before 0.0.0-20200124225646-8b5121be2f68 for Go) allows attacks on clients resulting in a panic via a malformed X.509 certificate. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

  ### Patches

  A patch to compile Helm against Go 1.14.4 has been provided for Helm 2 and is available in Helm 2.16.8. Helm 3.1.0 and newer are compiled against Go 1.13.7+.

  ### Workarounds

  No workaround is available. Users are urged to upgrade.
