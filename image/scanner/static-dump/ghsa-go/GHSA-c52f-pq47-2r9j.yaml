  ### Impact

  During a security audit of Helm's code base, Helm maintainers identified a bug in which a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack.

  To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection).

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2.

  ### Workarounds

  Make sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.
