  ### Impact

  An authentication bypass exists in the [goxmldsig](https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/security/advisories/GHSA-q547-gmf8-8jr7) this library uses to determine if SAML assertions are genuine. An attacker could craft a SAML response that would appear to be valid but would not have been genuinely issued by the IDP.

  ### Patches

  Version 0.4.2 bumps the dependency which should fix the issue.

  ### For more information

  Please see [the advisory in goxmldsig](https://github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/security/advisories/GHSA-q547-gmf8-8jr7)
