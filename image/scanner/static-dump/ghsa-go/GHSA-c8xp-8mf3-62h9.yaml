description: "Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI prior to https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/commit/a8db4e009ef217484598ba1fd1c595b54e0f6422
  into emitting an invalid VRP \"MaxLength\" value, causing RTR sessions to terminate.
  \n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can use this to disable RPKI Origin Validation in
  a victim network (for example AS 13335 - Cloudflare) prior to launching a BGP hijack
  which during normal operations would be rejected as \"RPKI invalid\". Additionally,
  in certain deployments RTR session flapping in and of itself also could cause BGP
  routing churn, causing availability issues.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/commit/a8db4e009ef217484598ba1fd1c595b54e0f6422\n\nhttps://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/releases/tag/v1.3.0\n\n###
