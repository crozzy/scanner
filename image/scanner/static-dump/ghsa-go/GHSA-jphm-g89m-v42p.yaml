description: An issue was discovered in Grafana Cortex through 1.9.0. The header value
  X-Scope-OrgID is used to construct file paths for rules files, and if crafted to
  conduct directory traversal such as ae ../../sensitive/path/in/deployment pathname,
  then Cortex will attempt to parse a rules file at that location and include some
  of the contents in the error message. (Other Cortex API requests can also be sent
  a malicious OrgID header, e.g., tricking the ingester into writing metrics to a
  different location, but the effect is nuisance rather than information disclosure.)
