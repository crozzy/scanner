description: A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control
  the responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
  requests are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the
  apiserver. If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log level is set to
  10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs.
