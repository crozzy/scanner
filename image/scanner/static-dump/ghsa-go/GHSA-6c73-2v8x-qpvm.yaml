description: "### Impact\n\nWe are not aware of any exploits. This is a pro-active
  fix.\n\nImpacted: \n\n* You are running Argo Server < v3.0 with `--secure=true`
  or >= v3.0 with `--secure` unspecified (note - running in secure mode is recommended
  regardless).\n* The attacker is within your network. If you expose Argo Server to
  the Internet then \"your network\" is \"the Internet\". \n\nThe Argo Server's keys
  are packaged within the image. They could be extracted and used to decrypt traffic,
  or forge requests.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/6540\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\n* Make sure that your Argo Server service or pod are not directly
  accessible outside of your cluster. Put TLS load balancer in front of it.\n\nThis
