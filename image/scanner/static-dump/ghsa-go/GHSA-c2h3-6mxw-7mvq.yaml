description: "### Impact\nA bug was found in containerd where container root directories
  and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged
  Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers
  included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged
  Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged
  Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container,
  the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files.\n\n###
  Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7.
  Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers
  or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nLimit
  access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles
  directories. \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments
