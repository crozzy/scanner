description: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root
  users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can
  be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file
  in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not
  allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means
  that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest
  threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well
  as system availability.
