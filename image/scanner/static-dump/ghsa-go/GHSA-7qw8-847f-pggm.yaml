description: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage'
  in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked
  using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an
  error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the
  tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability
  to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using
  containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
