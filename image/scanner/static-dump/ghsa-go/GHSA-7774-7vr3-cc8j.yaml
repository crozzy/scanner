description: "### Impact\nAccording to [RFC 4343](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4343),
  Istio authorization policy should compare the hostname in the HTTP Host header in
  a case insensitive way, but currently the comparison is case sensitive.  The Envoy
  proxy will route the request hostname in a case-insensitive way which means the
  authorization policy could be bypassed.\n \nAs an example, the user may have an
  authorization policy that rejects request with hostname \"httpbin.foo\" for some
  source IPs, but the attacker can bypass this by sending the request with hostname
  \"Httpbin.Foo\".\n\n### Patches\n* Istio 1.11.1 and above\n* Istio 1.10.4 and above\n*
  Istio 1.9.8 and above\n\n### Workarounds\nA Lua filter may be written to normalize
  Host header before the authorization check.  This is similar to the Path normalization
  presented in the [Security Best Practices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#case-normalization)
  guide.\n\n### References\nMore details can be found in the [Istio Security Bulletin](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2021-008)\n\n###
