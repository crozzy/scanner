description: jwt-go allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations
  with []string{} for m["aud"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the
  type assertion fails, "" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the
  JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check. There is
  no patch available and users of jwt-go are advised to migrate to [golang-jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt)
  at version 3.2.1
